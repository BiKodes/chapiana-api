**Version 1.0.0**

This is a RESTFUL API that manages personal contacts of the user and maps every single contact to its owner with their specific images respectively.

## Acknowledgements

I am blessed to be surrounded by many extraordinary people in my life.Without them, it would not be possible for me to do what I do and advance in my mission of being an apristine Software Craftsman. I am deeply grateful.

I must offer special thanks to: 

- **Engineer** [Josephat Macharia](https://gitlab.com/joemash) 

Whom I count on in so very many ways and whose enthusiasm for software development always inspires me.

## Architecture

This project impliments the follwing **layers**:

#### 1. Presentation Layer

This represents logic that consume the user logic from the `Usecase Layer`
and renders to the view. Here you can choose to render the view in either `swagger` or `redoc`

#### 2. Application Layer

The application specific logic lives here, this includes  interfaces, views, serializers, models etc.

## Patterns Used

- #### 12 Factor App

The project has been structured as a 12 factor app. For detailed exploration check the link 
https://12factor.net/

- #### Unit of Work Pattern

This pattern coordinates the writing out of changes made to objects using the repository pattern.

    git clone https://github.com/BikoCodes/tests.git
  ```

3. Navigate to the contactsapi directory

  ```bash
    cd contactsapi
  ```

4. Install the requirements:

  ```bash
   (venv)$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
  ```

5. Configure the specified environment variables below in an env.sh file:

  ```bash
    export  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@localhost/<database>
    export  TEST_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/dev.db
    export  SECRET_KEY=not-so-secret

    export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= provided by Google
    export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= provided by Google
  ```

6. Source the environment variables.
